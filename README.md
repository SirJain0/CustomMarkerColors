# Custom Marker Colors
Allows users to add their own marker colors.
## Worth noting:
- Marker IDs are auto-generated from your marker name. They are the same as your marker name, but lower-case and with underscores instead of spaces.
- Currently, the only way to get rid of your custom markers altogether is to uninstall the plugin and restart Blockbench.
- You can use these marker colors for meshes and keyframes too!
## How to use:
To use this plugin, go to the menu where the marker colors are listed. There will be a brand new <b>Add Custom Marker</b> at the top. Upon clicking, fill out the required information, making sure to leave no fields blank, and you're good to go! The marker is added to the default list, ready to be used.
